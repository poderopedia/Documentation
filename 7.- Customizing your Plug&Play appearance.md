* visualizacionLayoutCuentas.html: for the user-area layout.
* visualizacionLayoutCuentas2.html: for the user-login and response messages in the user-area layout.
* visualizacionLayoutDocument.html: for the DocumentCloud and the data visualization layout.
* visualizacionLayoutEstaticas: for statics pages like about, teams, etc.

The header and footer files are located in the views/includes directory:

* footer.html (same for all layouts)
* header-publico.html (public header)
* header-privado.html (private header when an user is logged)


All the static files (js, css, images files) are under the static directory:
